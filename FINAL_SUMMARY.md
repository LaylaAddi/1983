## 🔍 **Example Transformation**

### **Before (Template Only)**:
```
On March 15, 2025, Plaintiff was lawfully present at Main Street Park.

[USER'S RAW DESCRIPTION INSERTED HERE]
```

### **After (AI-Enhanced)**:
```
On March 15, 2025, Plaintiff was lawfully present at Main Street Park in
Springfield, Illinois, a traditional public forum, exercising the clearly
established First Amendment right to record police officers performing their
duties in public.

While standing on a public sidewalk and holding a camera in plain view,
Plaintiff observed and recorded Defendant Officers conducting what appeared
to be a traffic stop. Defendant Officer Johnson approached Plaintiff and
ordered Plaintiff to "stop filming." When Plaintiff declined and explained
their constitutional right to record, Defendant Johnson threatened to arrest
Plaintiff for "obstruction of justice" if Plaintiff did not immediately cease
recording and leave the public area.

Plaintiff's conduct was peaceful, non-obstructive, and posed no interference
with legitimate law enforcement activities. Plaintiff remained at a safe
distance on the public sidewalk throughout the encounter.
```

## 📞 **Support & Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**:

**"AI not working"**
- Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Check user's budget: `UserProfile.remaining_api_budget`
- Check logs for OpenAI API errors

**"Over budget immediately"**
- Reset user: `profile.total_api_cost = Decimal('0.00')`
- Or increase limit: `profile.api_cost_limit = Decimal('5.00')`

**"All sections using templates"**
- This is correct! AI only enhances 4 sections
- jurisdiction, prayer, jury_demand use templates (by design)

### **Monitoring**:

```python
# Check total AI spending
from accounts.models import UserProfile
from django.db.models import Sum

total = UserProfile.objects.aggregate(Sum('total_api_cost'))
print(f"Total spent: ${total['total_api_cost__sum']}")

# Users approaching limit
approaching = UserProfile.objects.filter(
    total_api_cost__gte=0.40,  # 80% of $0.50
    total_api_cost__lt=0.50
)
for p in approaching:
    print(f"{p.user.username}: {p.usage_percentage}%")

# AI-enhanced sections today
from documents.models import DocumentSection
from django.utils import timezone
from datetime import timedelta

today = timezone.now() - timedelta(days=1)
ai_sections = DocumentSection.objects.filter(
    ai_enhanced=True,
    created_at__gte=today
)
print(f"AI sections created today: {ai_sections.count()}")
```
